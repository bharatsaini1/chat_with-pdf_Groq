# Chat PDF ðŸ’¬ðŸ“š

Chat PDF is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload PDF files and ask questions about their content. The application leverages Google's Gemini API for embeddings and conversational AI to provide precise and contextual answers based on the uploaded PDF documents.

---

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files for processing.
- Extract text from PDF files.
- Split text into manageable chunks for efficient querying.
- Vectorize text chunks using Google Gemini embeddings.
- Store and persist embeddings using Chroma.
- Answer user questions based on the context extracted from PDF files.

## Requirements

### Python Libraries

The following Python libraries are required:

- `streamlit`
- `PyPDF2`
- `langchain`
- `langchain-google-genai`
- `google-generativeai`
- `dotenv`
- `chromadb`

### Environment Variables

The application uses the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to connect to the Google Gemini API. You need to set up a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```plaintext
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
```
